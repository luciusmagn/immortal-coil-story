;;; The King in Yellow path, Act I - the ordinary city.
;;;
;;; Rebuilt from Chambers, no JRPG skeleton kept. The player begins ALONE with
;;; the banned Play and the Yellow Sign already half on them, and walks the
;;; night city of the stories: the painter Scott and his model Tessie of THE
;;; YELLOW SIGN, the churchyard watchman, and the pursuing organist of IN THE
;;; COURT OF THE DRAGON, which is the crossing into Carcosa. JRPG mechanics are
;;; kept (overworld travel, turn battles against the human menace of the city,
;;; stats, items, composure); the village, the quest, and the demon lord are
;;; gone. Companions, if any, are picked up later and only if they fit.

;;; Each is an optional detour that rejoins the main road, and each turns on the

;;; gesture. THE DEMOISELLE D'YS (a fugue out of time), THE PROPHETS' PARADISE
;;; (the Play's looping middle pages), and the four Paris street stories (an old
;;; quarter the Sign keeps in its last good minute).
;;; ===========================================================================


;;; THE DEMOISELLE D'YS - a green lane off the thinned city drops the player
;;; five centuries back onto the Breton moor, into a love that has already
;;; happened and a death already on the stone. The falconer is named Hastur,
;;; the same name a scarred man gave a god an hour ago.

;;; THE NIGHT-CITY HUB (in-city grid). The player chooses which district to
;;; enter and in what order; a finished district drops its door on re-entry; the
;;; church door is always open and is the crossing - leave by it early and you
;;; simply miss the stories you did not walk into. The flyleaf's "again" brings
;;; you back to find them. This is where the player's agency lives.
